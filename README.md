# The Transformation Portal (Meditation App)

**Status:** [Prototype / In Development] 

## 1. The Mission This Code Serves

This repository contains the "Transformation Portal," a core component of our "Intentional Evolution" app suite.

Its mission is to provide a digital sanctuary for healing. Millions of survivors of trauma (military, abuse, systemic) are failed by traditional clinical and religious institutions. This application provides a direct, private, and secure spiritual tool for self-guided recovery.

This is the kind of resource I personally needed for the last 50 years as a TERA-environment veteran navigating my own recovery from invisible wounds.

## 2. What It Does (The Solution)
This project is a meditation and self-coaching application that:
* Guides users through our proprietary "8 A's of Transformation" framework.
* Provides a secure, private space for meditation and self-reflection.
* Connects to our broader "Pinnacle" self-coaching ecosystem.

## 3. Technology
* **Core:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* **Platform:** Web (designed for desktop and mobile)
